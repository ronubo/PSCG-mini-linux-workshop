# allow doing "bashrc" style stuff like aliases etc.
# This can also be done by populating /etc/profile , however I am doing it in the following way for the sake of the example: 
# ronenv will be a file to be populated externally (if, nothing bad will happen if it's empty). 
# You can also just populate it yourself from your running shell e.g. # ' echo "alias ll='ls -l' > ronenv , then execute 'sh' and you will see that you will the alias in the other shell
export ENV=ronenv 

# get rid of annoying job control message - it is not really necessary.
# also this is tailored for our exact scenario where we use the console as ttyS0 - be careful if you copy it to another platform, or in a graphical mode!
# For a more elegant solution, use cttyhack; https://git.busybox.net/busybox/plain/shell/cttyhack.c?id=dcaed97
#exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/console >/dev/console 2>&1' # this will not work, although it is tempting to do so
#exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/ttyS0 >/dev/ttyS0 2>&1'     # use this for qemu with x86
#exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/ttyAMA0 > /dev/ttyAMA0 2>&1' # use this for qemu with aarch64 and virt
exec setsid cttyhack sh

# Whatever is here will not run if you do not comment the previous line, because exec replaces the image.
# Extra notes for demonstration: Comment the above (setsid line) if you run qemu with graphical mode and you want to use the console. Otherwise, you will think the console gets stuck - while it doesn't.
